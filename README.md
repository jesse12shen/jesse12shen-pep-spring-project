# Revature Project: Spring Social media blog API

## Background 

This project was my final project in the Revature bootcamp curriculumn. You will find code I have written under <code>src/main/java/com/example</code> where I have written the <code>controller, repository</code>, and <code>entity</code> classes. 

The exact project instructions have been moved to <code>Project-Instructions.md</code>. The goal of this project is to serve as a backend for a hypothetical social media app where usersâ€™ accounts are managed as well as any messages that users may submit to the application. A previous version of this project introduced using JDBC to create a persistent database and endpoints using a DAO design pattern, but this project uses Spring to execute this functionality in a MVC design pattern.
